# Town Hall – Newark AI Community Nonprofit

## Project Brief

**Concept:** A community-facing nonprofit that hosts free AI town halls, training sessions, and educational content for Newark residents with mixed technical backgrounds. Emphasizes accessibility, plain language, and building lasting community connections via Discord, events, and a content hub (blog/vlog).

**Goals:**
- Demystify AI for everyday people
- Provide free, relevant training (e.g., "AI for small business", "AI and privacy")
- Build engaged community (not just one-off attendees)
- Empower Newark residents to participate in AI conversation, not just consume it
- Create volunteer opportunities for NJIT students

## 1. Discovery & User Research

### Stakeholder Interviews Script (Simulated)

#### Interview 1: Newark Small Business Owner (No AI Background)
**Goal:** Understand business owner's perspective, needs, barriers

**Questions:**
1. What does "AI" mean to you? What questions do you have about it?
2. Are you using any AI tools in your business today? (Knowingly or unknowingly?)
3. What's your biggest fear about AI (privacy, job loss, cost)?
4. If there was a free workshop on "AI for small business", would you attend? Why/why not?
5. How would you prefer to learn? In-person, online, video?

**Sample Insights:**
- AI feels abstract; wants concrete examples ("How can *I* use this?")
- Skeptical of tech hype; needs proof it's worth time investment
- Privacy concerns are real; wants reassurance
- In-person workshops feel more trustworthy than online videos alone

---

#### Interview 2: Community Organizer / School Administrator
**Goal:** Understand institutional perspective, partnership potential

**Questions:**
1. What's the biggest skill gap you see in your community?
2. Would your organization host a free training event? What would that look like?
3. How do you reach people who aren't actively looking for training (the skeptics)?
4. What topics would resonate most? (Privacy, business applications, career prep, ethics?)
5. How do you measure success of a community program?

**Sample Insights:**
- Credibility matters; wants backing from trusted institutions (NJIT, schools)
- Marketing is hard; word-of-mouth and partnerships are key
- Hands-on + theory combo works better than lecture alone
- Post-event connection (Discord, follow-up emails) keeps momentum

---

#### Interview 3: Newark Resident (Tech-Curious, Low Literacy)
**Goal:** Understand everyday person's barriers and motivations

**Questions:**
1. What made you interested in attending an AI event?
2. What does "AI" mean in plain English?
3. What worries you about AI? What excites you?
4. Would you attend a follow-up Discord community? How would you use it?
5. What would make you refer a friend?

**Sample Insights:**
- Needs jargon-free explanations with relatable examples
- Worried about being "too old" or "not tech-savvy enough"
- Values peer learning (wants others at her skill level)
- Wants to connect with others and keep learning post-event

## 2. Strategy & Planning

### Customer Journey Map: "Resident Sees Flyer → Attends → Stays Engaged"

```
STAGE 1: AWARENESS & DISCOVERY
├─ Touchpoint: Flyer at community center, Facebook ad, word-of-mouth, email
├─ Task: Understand what event is about, whether it's for me
├─ Pain point: Skeptical, "not for people like me", time pressure
├─ Opportunity: Clear, jargon-free description; "all skill levels welcome"; local venue
└─ Action: Decides to attend; registers online or shows up

STAGE 2: PRE-EVENT ANTICIPATION
├─ Touchpoint: Confirmation email + prep resources
├─ Task: Know what to expect, reduce anxiety, prepare mentally
├─ Pain point: Worried about feeling lost or judged
├─ Opportunity: Email: "Bring your questions, no stupid questions", "Everyone's learning"
└─ Action: Looks at prep materials (optional); feels more confident

STAGE 3: EVENT ATTENDANCE
├─ Touchpoint: In-person event (or Zoom)
├─ Task: Attend, learn, feel part of community
├─ Pain point: May feel overwhelmed; fear of "not getting it"
├─ Opportunity: Small group format, Q&A throughout, social time before/after, free refreshments
└─ Action: Attends full event; asks questions; meets other attendees

STAGE 4: IMMEDIATE POST-EVENT
├─ Touchpoint: Follow-up email (within 24 hours)
├─ Task: Reinforce learning; invite to community
├─ Pain point: Momentum fades; hard to know what to do next
├─ Opportunity: Email: Recording, takeaways summary, next event, Discord invite, action items
└─ Action: Joins Discord; maybe watches recording later

STAGE 5: ONGOING ENGAGEMENT
├─ Touchpoint: Discord community (#ai-questions, #events, monthly workshop), email updates
├─ Task: Keep learning, stay connected, support others
├─ Pain point: Discord can be intimidating; might not post
├─ Opportunity: Moderated channels, "Ask Anything Tuesdays", monthly member showcase, buddy system
└─ Action: Lurks initially, then asks questions; encourages friend to join

STAGE 6: VOLUNTEER / AMBASSADOR
├─ Touchpoint: Volunteer opportunities (setup crew, host, community liaisons)
├─ Task: Give back, deepen learning, own the mission
├─ Pain point: May not think they have skills to help
├─ Opportunity: Clear volunteer roles (no experience needed), training provided, celebration
└─ Action: Hosts event, recruits peers, becomes "Town Hall person"

STAGE 7: SUSTAINED COMMUNITY MEMBER
├─ Touchpoint: Recurring events, Discord, shared mission
├─ Task: Ongoing learning, mentorship (newcomers), advocacy

   - Write plain-language description

2. **Promotion (10 days before)**
   - Create event page on website
   - Design event flyer (PDF + digital)
   - Post to Facebook, Discord #events
